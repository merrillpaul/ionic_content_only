<p>Replace the 3 x 4 Response Grid with the 4 x 4 Response Grid (make sure that the orientation arrows are pointing toward the Client Device). Add two Response Chips to the existing six (for a total of eight chips).</p>

<p>Say, <span class="speechBlue">Now, these next ones are a little more difficult. I want you to put the chips on this grid where you saw the pictures. Let&#39;s try one.</span></p>

<p><img class="give_stimTimerNoThumbnail" customtimeout="false" data-stim-number="1" duration="2" src="" /></p>

<p>Give instructions for chip placement if needed. After you have recorded the examinee&#39;s response, remove the chips from the grid.</p>

<p>Say, <span class="speechBlue">I&#39;m going to show you another screen with a picture on it. Look very carefully and when the screen goes blank, put a chip on the grid in the same place you saw the picture on the screen. Ready?</span></p>

<p><img class="give_stimTimerNoThumbnail" customtimeout="false" data-stim-number="1" duration="2" src="" />â€‹</p>

<p>When the screen clears, say, <span class="speechBlue">Using one of these chips, show me where the picture was on the screen.</span></p>

<p>After you have recorded the examinee&#39;s response, remove the chip from the grid.</p>

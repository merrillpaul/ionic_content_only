<p>Say, <span class="speechBlue">Now I&rsquo;m going to show you a new screen with red dots on it. I want you to look very carefully at the dots and remember where they are on the screen. Do you understand?</span></p>

<p><img class="give_stimTimerNoThumbnail" customtimeout="false" data-stim-number="1" duration="5" src="" /></p>

<p>After the screen clears, say, <span class="speechBlue">Now take the chips and show me where the dots were.</span> (Point to the Response Chips and Response Grid.)</p>

<p>Allow the examinee ample time to respond. After recording the chip placement, remove the chips from the Response Grid and place them in front of the examinee.</p>

<p>Say,&nbsp;<span class="speechBlue">I&#39;m going to show you a screen with blue dots on it. I want you to look very carefully at the dots and remember where they are on the screen. Then the dots will disappear from the screen, and I want you to put the chips</span>&nbsp;(point to the Response Chips)&nbsp;<span class="speechBlue">on this grid</span>&nbsp;(point to the Response Grid)&nbsp;<span class="speechBlue">in the same places that you saw the dots on the screen. Ready? Let&#39;s try it. Look closely.</span></p>

<p>Say, <span class="speechBlue">Let&#39;s try it again.</span>&nbsp;<span class="speechBlue">I&#39;ll show you the same screen with blue dots on it.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><img class="give_stimTimerNoThumbnail" customtimeout="false" data-stim-number="1" duration="5" src="" /></p>

<p>After the screen clears, say,&nbsp;<span class="speechBlue">Now take the chips and show me where the dots were.</span>&nbsp;(Point to the Response Chips and Response Grid.)</p>

<p>Allow the examinee ample time to respond.&nbsp;After recording the chip placement, remove the chips from the Response Grid and place them in front of the examinee.</p>

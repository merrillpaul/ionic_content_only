<p>To begin administration, give the examinee a pencil without an eraser and say, <span class="speechBlue">You will be using a pencil without an eraser, so if you make a&nbsp;mistake, just cross it out.</span></p>

<p>Open the Response Booklet to Math Fluency - Addition, with both pages facing the examinee, and say, <span class="speechBlue">I want you to write the&nbsp;answers to as many math problems as you can in one minute.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Point to the first item and say, <span class="speechBlue">Start here and work the problems in this order.</span></p>

<p>Demonstrate by sweeping your finger from left to right across the first row and then across the next row of the first page. Encourage the examinee&nbsp;to proceed by row, completing the left page first, then the right page.</p>

<p>Say, <span class="speechBlue">If you come to a problem that you don&rsquo;t know, just skip it. Do you have any questions?</span></p>

<p>When the examinee&nbsp;is ready, point to the first item and say, <span class="speechBlue">Begin. </span></p>

<p><img class="give_timer" src="" /></p>

<p>If the student does not work the problems in the order specified, immediately redirect the student to the appropriate item order, but do not stop timing.</p>

<p>At the end of 60 seconds say, <span class="speechBlue">Stop.</span></p>

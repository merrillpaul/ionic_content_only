<p>Turn the Response Booklet to Math Fluency - Multiplication, with both pages facing the examinee, and say, <span class="speechBlue">Now write the answers&nbsp;to as many of these math problems as you can in one minute. Work the problems in the same order as before. </span></p>

<p>Demonstrate again by&nbsp;sweeping your finger from left to right across the first row and then across the next row of the first page.</p>

<p>Point to the first item and say, <span class="speechBlue">Begin. </span></p>

<p>If the examinee does not work the problems in the order specified, immediately redirect the&nbsp;student to the appropriate item order, but do not stop timing.</p>

<p>At the end of 60 seconds say, <span class="speechBlue">Stop.</span></p>

<p><strong>Full instructions (if no other Math Fluency subtests were previously administered):</strong></p>

<p>To begin administration, give the examinee a pencil without an eraser and say,&nbsp;<span class="speechBlue">You will be using a pencil without an eraser, so if you make a&nbsp;mistake, just cross it out.</span></p>

<p>Open the Response Booklet to Math Fluency - Addition, with both pages facing the examinee, and say,&nbsp;<span class="speechBlue">I want you to write the&nbsp;answers to as many math problems as you can in one minute.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Point to the first item and say,&nbsp;<span class="speechBlue">Start here and work the problems in this order.</span></p>

<p>Demonstrate by sweeping your finger from left to right across the first row and then across the next row of the first page. Encourage the&nbsp;examinee to proceed by row, completing the left page first, then the right page.</p>

<p>Say,&nbsp;<span class="speechBlue">If you come to a problem that you don&rsquo;t know, just skip it. Do you have any questions?</span></p>

<p>When the examinee is ready, point to the first item and say,&nbsp;<span class="speechBlue">Begin.</span></p>

<p>Begin timing using the timer above and follow the rest of the instructions as specified.</p>

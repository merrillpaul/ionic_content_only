<p>Say, <span class="speechBlue">Scuba Bob is planning to dive to a depth of 60 feet, and his scuba tanks will last 19.5 minutes while on the surface. Assuming Scuba Bob can safely descend and rise to the surface at 2 feet per second, and at a depth of 60 feet he uses 10% more air, how many minutes can he safely stay on the bottom?</span></p>

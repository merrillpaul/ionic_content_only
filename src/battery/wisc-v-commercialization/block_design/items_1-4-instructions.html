<p>Introduce the <em>WISC&ndash;V Digital Edition</em> by saying,&nbsp;<strong><span class="speechBlue">We&rsquo;ll be doing a lot of things today, like looking at pictures, answering questions, and working with blocks. Some things may be easy for you, but some may be hard. Just try your best.</span></strong></p>

<p>To introduce the Block Design subtest, place two blocks in front of the child.&nbsp;Pick up one block and say,<span class="speechBlue">&nbsp;<strong>See these blocks? They are all alike. On some sides, they are all red</strong>&nbsp;</span>(show red side)<strong><span class="speechBlue">; on some sides, all white</span></strong>&nbsp;(show white side)<span class="speechBlue"><strong>; and on some sides, half red and half white</strong>&nbsp;</span>(show red-and-white side)<strong><span class="speechBlue">.</span></strong></p>

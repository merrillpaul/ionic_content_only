<p>Ensure the thin gray bar is at the bottom of the child&rsquo;s screen, closest to the child. If necessary, rotate the tablet.</p>

<p>Follow the instructions on the screen.</p>

<p>Present the blocks with a variety of surfaces facing up. For Item 1, each block should have a different side facing up. For items with four blocks, only one block should have a red-and-white side facing up. For items with nine blocks, only two blocks should have a red-and-white side facing up.</p>

<p>With the exception of Item 13, which includes a required introduction to nine-block items, verbatim instructions for Items 6&ndash;16 may be shortened when the child understands the task.</p>

<p>Detailed administration and scoring information can be accessed by touching the ⓘ button. For increased accessibility during administration, verbatim prompts also can be accessed by touching the speech button.</p>

<p>Touch the Start button on the stopwatch to start timing after the last word of instruction. Stop timing when it is clear that the child has completed the item. If necessary (e.g., the child alters the construction after timing was stopped), touch Resume to continue timing until it is clear that the child has completed the item.</p>

<p>Record the child&rsquo;s final construction on the Response grid.&nbsp;See the Record &amp; Score section of the ⓘ button for more information.</p>

<p>For <em><strong>all items</strong></em>, touch the # Correct Blocks button to enter the number of correctly placed blocks in the child&rsquo;s final construction. This information is <em><strong>required</strong></em>.&nbsp;Only enter the numeral, not the word (e.g., &quot;1&quot; not &quot;one&quot;).</p>

<p>Indicate any errors by touching the Configuration Break, Rotation&gt;=30&deg;, and Gap buttons. If applicable, specify the degree of rotation by using your thumb and index finger to rotate the Response grid until the child&rsquo;s degree of rotation is reflected.</p>

<p>Score the child&rsquo;s construction.</p>

To record the event, first touch the List button, and then touch&nbsp;<strong>1F</strong>.</p>

<p>If the child finishes all of the test items on a page and does not touch the arrow or does not touch the arrow hard enough to advance the page, touch the arrow on the child&rsquo;s screen and say,&nbsp;<strong><span class="speechBlue">When you finish a page, touch the arrow and keep working as fast as you can.</span></strong>&nbsp;Do&nbsp;<strong>not&nbsp;</strong>pause timing to provide this prompt. To record the event, first touch the List button, and then touch&nbsp;<strong>AA</strong>.</p>

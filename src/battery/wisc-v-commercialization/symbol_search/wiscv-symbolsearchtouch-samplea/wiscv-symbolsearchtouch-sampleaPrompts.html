<p>Say,&nbsp;<span class="speechBlue"><strong>Now you do these</strong></span>&nbsp;(point to sample items)<span class="speechBlue">.</span><strong><span class="speechBlue">&nbsp;If you see the shape, touch it.

<p>Say, <span class="speechBlue"><strong>Go ahead.&nbsp;</strong></span>Allow the child to complete the sample items. If the child responds correctly,&nbsp;the test&nbsp;will advance to the next sample item. The test will not advance if the sample item is answered incorrectly.

<p><strong>Correct:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Say, <span class="speechBlue"><strong>That&rsquo;s right.&nbsp;</strong></span><span class="speechBlue"><strong>Now you know how to do them. </strong></span>Proceed to Test Items.</p>

<p><strong>Incorrect:</strong></p>

<p>Correct the error(s) immediately, as follows:</p>

<p>If the child incorrectly touches NO on the first or third sample item, say,&nbsp;<span class="speechBlue"><strong>That&rsquo;s not quite right. This shape&nbsp;</strong></span>(point to target symbol)&nbsp;<span class="speechBlue"><strong>is the same as this one&nbsp;</strong></span>(point to matching symbol in search group)<span class="speechBlue"><strong>, so you should touch it.</strong></span> Do NOT touch the response during teaching. Allow the child to touch the response. Teach until the child responds correctly.</p>

<p>If the child incorrectly touches a non-target symbol in the search group on the first or third sample item, say,&nbsp;<span class="speechBlue"><strong>That&rsquo;s not quite right. This shape</strong></span>&nbsp;(point to error)<span class="speechBlue"><strong>&nbsp;is <em>not </em>the same as this one&nbsp;</strong></span>(point to target symbol)<span class="speechBlue"><strong>, so you should <em>not</em> touch it.</strong></span> Do NOT touch the response during teaching. Allow the child to touch the response. Teach until the child responds correctly.</p>

<p>If the child incorrectly touches the rotated target symbol on the second sample item, say, <span class="speechBlue"><strong>That&rsquo;s not quite right. Even though this shape</strong></span> (point to rotated target in search group) <span class="speechBlue"><strong>looks like this one </strong></span>(point to target symbol)<span class="speechBlue"><strong>, you should <em>not </em>touch it because it&rsquo;s turned the wrong way. You should touch the NO box.</strong></span> Do NOT touch the response during teaching. Allow the child to touch the response. Teach until the child responds correctly.</p>

<p>If the child incorrectly touches any other symbol in the search group on the second sample item, say,&nbsp;<span class="speechBlue"><strong>That&rsquo;s not quite right. This shape&nbsp;</strong></span>(point to error)<span class="speechBlue"><strong>&nbsp;is <em>not</em> the same as this one</strong></span>&nbsp;(point to target symbol)<span class="speechBlue"><strong>, so you should <em>not </em>touch it.</strong></span> Do NOT touch the response during teaching. Allow the child to touch the response. Teach until the child responds correctly.</p>

<p>If it is clear that the child will not correctly complete the sample items or understand the task with further instruction, discontinue the subtest.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When the child has successfully completed the sample items, proceed to Test Items.</p>

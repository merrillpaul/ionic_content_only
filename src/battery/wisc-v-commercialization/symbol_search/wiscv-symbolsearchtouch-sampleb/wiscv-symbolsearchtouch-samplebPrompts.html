<p>Say, <span class="speechBlue"><strong>Now you do these</strong></span> (point to sample items)<strong><span class="speechBlue">. If you see one of the shapes, touch it. If you don&rsquo;t see one of the shapes, touch the NO box. Then you can work on the next one.</span></strong></p>

<p>Say, <span class="speechBlue"><strong>Go ahead. </strong></span>Allow the child to complete the sample items. If the child responds correctly, the test will advance to the next sample item. The test will not advance if the sample item is answered incorrectly.&nbsp;If the child responds incorrectly, provide feedback as described below.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Incorrect:</strong></p>

<p>Correct the error(s)&nbsp;immediately, as follows:</p>

<p>If the child incorrectly touches NO on the first or third sample item, say,&nbsp;<span class="speechBlue"><strong>That&rsquo;s not quite right. This shape&nbsp;</strong></span>(point to first target symbol)&nbsp;<span class="speechBlue"><strong>is the same as this one&nbsp;</strong></span>(point to matching&nbsp;target symbol in search group)<span class="speechBlue"><strong>, so you should touch it.</strong></span> Do NOT touch the response during teaching. Allow the child to touch the response. Teach until the child responds correctly.</p>

<p>If the child incorrectly touches a non-target symbol in the search group on the first or third sample item, say,&nbsp;<span class="speechBlue"><strong>That&rsquo;s not quite right. This shape</strong></span>&nbsp;(point to error)<span class="speechBlue"><strong>&nbsp;is <em>not </em>the same as either one of these&nbsp;</strong></span>(point to each target symbol)<span class="speechBlue"><strong>, so you should <em>not </em>touch it.</strong></span> Do NOT touch the response during teaching. Allow the child to touch the response. Teach until the child responds correctly.</p>

<p>If the child incorrectly touches the rotated target symbol on the second sample item, say, <span class="speechBlue"><strong>That&rsquo;s not quite right. Even though this shape </strong></span>(point to rotated target in search group) <span class="speechBlue"><strong>looks like this one </strong></span>(point to target symbol)<span class="speechBlue"><strong>, you should <em>not </em>touch it because it&rsquo;s turned the wrong way.</strong></span> Do NOT touch the response during teaching. Allow the child to touch the response. Teach until the child responds correctly.</p>

<p>If the child incorrectly touches any other symbol in the search group on the second sample item, say,&nbsp;<span class="speechBlue"><strong>That&rsquo;s not quite right. This shape&nbsp;</strong></span>(point to error)<span class="speechBlue"><strong>&nbsp;is <em>not </em>the same as either&nbsp;one of these</strong></span>&nbsp;(point to each target symbol)<span class="speechBlue"><strong>, so you should <em>not </em>touch it.</strong></span> Do NOT touch the response during teaching. Allow the child to touch the response. Teach until the child responds correctly.</p>

<p>If it is clear that the child will not correctly complete the sample items or understand the task with further instruction, discontinue the subtest.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When the child has successfully completed the sample items, proceed to Test Items.</p>

<p>Read each item verbatim to the child.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>Read the response options verbatim to the child, but do&nbsp;<em><strong>not&nbsp;</strong></em>include the letter (i.e., A, B, C, or D) that identifies the response option.</p>

<p>Verbatim instructions may be shortened or eliminated when the child understands the task.</p>

<p>If the child selects the correct response, touch the symbol to turn it green.</p>

<p>Touching a green symbol a second time changes it back to white, indicating an incorrect response or no response.</p>

<p>If the child selects an incorrect response or does not respond, leave the symbol in its default state (i.e., white).</p>

<p>Touch the 0 Points button if the child selects an incorrect response, says he or she does not know the answer, or&nbsp;does not respond within&nbsp;<em>approximately&nbsp;</em>30 seconds.</p>

<p>Touch&nbsp;<strong>DK&nbsp;</strong>if the child says he or she does not know the answer. Touch&nbsp;<strong>NR&nbsp;</strong>if the child does not respond within&nbsp;<em>approximately&nbsp;</em>30 seconds.</p>

<p>Detailed administration and scoring information can be accessed at any time during administration by touching the&nbsp;â“˜&nbsp;button. For increased accessibility, verbatim prompts also can be accessed by touching the speech&nbsp;button.</p>

<p>Follow the instructions on the screen.</p>

<p>Detailed administration and scoring information can be accessed at any time during administration by touching the&nbsp;â“˜&nbsp;button. For increased accessibility, verbatim prompts also can be accessed by touching the speech&nbsp;button.</p>

<p>Touch the Start button on the stopwatch to start&nbsp;timing. Stop timing when the child has completed an item.</p>

<p>If the child completes a test item within the time limit, stop timing and leave the gray stopwatch icon in its default location (i.e., do not touch the gray stopwatch icon).</p>

<p>If the child does not complete a test item within the time limit, stop the stopwatch and complete the following steps:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Touch and hold the gray stopwatch icon, then drag and release it on the last word the child attempted before the time limit expired. If necessary, repeat this process until the gray stopwatch is located after the last attempted word.</li>
	<li>When the icon is in the appropriate location, touch the icon to turn it blue and to turn the remaining words (i.e., words the child did not attempt) gray.</li>
</ul>

<p>Children aged 6&ndash;8 are required to track their progress across a row of elements with their finger. If the child does not use finger tracking, say,&nbsp;Use your finger to keep your place.&nbsp;Do&nbsp;not&nbsp;stop timing to provide this prompt.&nbsp;Touch the Finger Tracking button if the prompt is administered at any time during administration of an item.</p>

<p>Due to the rapid pace of administration, only&nbsp;<em>incorrect&nbsp;</em>responses&nbsp;are recorded.&nbsp;Ensure that each word retains the appropriate color for accurate scoring.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Touching a word once will turn it red, indicating an incorrect response.</li>
	<li>Touching the same word a second time will turn it yellow, indicating a self-correction.</li>
	<li>Touching the same word a third time will return it to white, indicating a correct response.</li>
</ul>

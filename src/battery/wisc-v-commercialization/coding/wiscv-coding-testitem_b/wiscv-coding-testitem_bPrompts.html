<p>Say,&nbsp;<strong><span class="speechBlue">When I say &ldquo;Go,&rdquo; do these the same way. Start here</span></strong>&nbsp;(point to first test item)<strong><span class="speechBlue">, go in order</span></strong>&nbsp;(point across row)<strong><span class="speechBlue">, and don&rsquo;t skip any. Work as fast as you can, without making mistakes, until I tell you to stop. Are you ready?</span></strong></p>

<p>Explain further if necessary, then say,<span class="speechBlue">&nbsp;<strong>Go.</strong></span></p>

<p>If the child completes all of the test items before the time limit expires, stop timing.</p>

<p>If the child is still working at 120 seconds, stop timing and&nbsp;say,<span class="speechBlue">&nbsp;<strong>Stop.</strong></span></p>

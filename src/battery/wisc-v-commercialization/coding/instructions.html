<p>If the child&rsquo;s screen becomes unresponsive due to secondary hand contact at any time during administration, say, <strong><span class="speechBlue">Don&rsquo;t let your hand touch the screen.</span></strong> Do <strong>not </strong>pause timing to provide this prompt. To record the event, first touch the List button, and then touch <strong>HC</strong>.</p>

<p>If the child finishes all of the test items on a page and does not touch the arrow or does not touch the arrow hard enough to advance the page, touch the arrow on the child&rsquo;s screen and say, <strong><span class="speechBlue">When you finish a page, touch the arrow and keep working as fast as you can.</span></strong> Do <strong>not </strong>pause timing to provide this prompt. To record the event, first touch the List button, and then touch&nbsp;<strong>AA</strong>.</p>

<p><em><strong>It is essential that you watch the child during completion of test items in the event that a prompt is required or the child hesitates to advance to the next page by touching the arrow.&nbsp;</strong></em></p>

<p>Detailed administration and scoring information can be accessed at any time during administration by touching the&nbsp;â“˜&nbsp;button. For increased accessibility, verbatim prompts also can be accessed by touching the speech&nbsp;button.</p>

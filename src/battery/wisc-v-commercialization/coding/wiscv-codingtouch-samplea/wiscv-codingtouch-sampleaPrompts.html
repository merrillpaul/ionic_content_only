Continue to help the child, if necessary, until the child correctly completes the sample items. Use explanations such as<span class="speechBlue"><strong>&nbsp;This is a square. The square has this mark </strong></span>(point to square in key)<span class="speechBlue"><strong>, so you should touch the same mark here </strong></span>(point to the mark)<span class="speechBlue"><strong>.</strong></span>&nbsp;Do NOT touch the response during teaching.

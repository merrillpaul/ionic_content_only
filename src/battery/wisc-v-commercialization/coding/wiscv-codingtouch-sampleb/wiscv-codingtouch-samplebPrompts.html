<p>Say,<span class="speechBlue">&nbsp;<strong>Now you do some&nbsp;</strong></span>(point to sample item)<span class="speechBlue"><strong>. Go ahead.</strong>&nbsp;</span>Allow the child to complete sample items. If the child responds correctly, the test will advance to the next sample item. The test will not advance if the sample item is answered incorrectly.&nbsp;If the child responds incorrectly, provide feedback as described below.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13.5pt;">Correct:&nbsp;</span></strong></p>

<p>If the child completes the sample items correctly, offer praise such as&nbsp;<span class="speechBlue"><strong>Yes&nbsp;</strong></span>or&nbsp;<span class="speechBlue"><strong>Right</strong></span>,&nbsp;and finally,&nbsp;<strong><span class="speechBlue">Now you know how to do them.</span>&nbsp;</strong>Proceed to Test Items.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13.5pt;">Incorrect:</span></strong></p>

<p>If the child makes a mistake on a sample item,&nbsp;correct the error immediately. Use the item to review use of the key. Continue to help the child, if necessary, until the child correctly completes the sample items. Use explanations such as<span class="speechBlue"><strong>&nbsp;This is a 9. The 9 has this mark&nbsp;</strong></span>(point to 9 in key)<span class="speechBlue"><strong>, so you should touch the same mark here&nbsp;</strong></span>(point to the mark)<span class="speechBlue"><strong>.</strong></span> Do NOT touch the response during teaching. Allow child to touch response. Teach until child responds correctly.</p>

<p>If it is clear that the child will not correctly complete the sample items or understand the task with further instruction, discontinue the subtest.</p>

<p>When the child has successfully completed the sample items, proceed to Test Items.</p>

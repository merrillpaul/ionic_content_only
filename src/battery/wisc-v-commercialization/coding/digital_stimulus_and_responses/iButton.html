<h3>General Directions</h3>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>The child must indicate his or her response by touching the selected response on the child&rsquo;s screen.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>No self-corrections are allowed on Test Items. Demo and sample items allow for self-corrections and will not advance until the correct response is selected.</p>
	</li>
	<li>Do not&nbsp;inadvertently touch the child&rsquo;s screen with your finger during administration of the demonstration and sample items, except when instructed (i.e., your finger should hover above the child&rsquo;s screen when instructed to point at the empty box and search group, and you should touch the child&rsquo;s screen when instructed to demonstrate touching marks).</li>
	<li>
	<p>Use the demonstration items to explain and illustrate the task to the child, then allow the child to practice by completing the sample items. If the child appears confused, repeat the explanation and demonstrate the task again, using the sample items. If it is clear the child will not be able to understand the task with further instruction, discontinue the subtest.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>During administration of the sample items, use the examiner&rsquo;s screen to monitor the child&rsquo;s responses so that immediate feedback may be provided. Correct responses are indicated with a green circle and incorrect responses are indicated with a red circle.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong><em>It is essential that you watch the child during completion of test items in the event that a prompt is required.&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A check mark appears on the child&rsquo;s screen when the time limit expires.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Provide no further assistance on this subtest.</p>
	</li>

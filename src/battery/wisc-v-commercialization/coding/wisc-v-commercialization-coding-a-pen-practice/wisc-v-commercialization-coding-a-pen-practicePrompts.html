<p>Hold up the Examinee Stylus and say, <strong><span class="speechBlue">See this pen? You can use it to draw on your screen</span></strong> (draw a few straight and curvy lines in the corner of the Pen Practice box on the child&rsquo;s screen)<strong><span class="speechBlue">. The pen is the <em>only </em>thing that should touch the screen. If your hand touches the screen</span></strong> (relax wrist to show secondary hand contact)<strong><span class="speechBlue">, the pen may stop&nbsp;working</span></strong><strong><span class="speechBlue">.</span></strong></p>

<p>Hand the child the Examinee Stylus and say, <strong><span class="speechBlue">Now you try. Use the pen to draw whatever you want in the box, but make sure the pen is the <em>only </em>thing that touches the screen. </span></strong>Allow the child to practice using the stylus, correcting inappropriate use immediately as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>If the child&rsquo;s stylus becomes unresponsive due to secondary hand contact, say,&nbsp;<strong><span class="speechBlue">Don&rsquo;t let your hand touch the screen.</span></strong></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>If the child has difficulty maintaining an appropriate grip on the stylus, hold up the Examiner Stylus using an appropriate writing grip and say, <strong><span class="speechBlue">Hold it like it&rsquo;s a pen.</span></strong></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>If the child applies too little or too much pressure to the stylus when drawing, say,&nbsp;<strong><span class="speechBlue">Try to draw a little</span></strong> (<strong><span class="speechBlue">softer, harder</span></strong>)<strong><span class="speechBlue">.</span></strong></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>If additional practice is necessary, touch the Redo Practice button to clear the drawing area.</p>

<p>When the child has demonstrated adequate stylus use, say, <strong><span class="speechBlue">Now you know how to use the pen.</span></strong></p>

<p>If it is clear that the child will be unable to demonstrate adequate stylus use to complete the subtest, touch the subtest discontinue hand button at the top of the examiner&rsquo;s screen to discontinue the subtest.</p>

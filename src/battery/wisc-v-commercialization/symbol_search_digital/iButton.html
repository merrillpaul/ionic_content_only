<h3>Timing</h3>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Accurate timing is essential. Once initiated, timing is automatic. Do not pause timing during completion of Test Items.</p>

<h3>General Directions</h3>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Each item in Form A contains one target symbol and a search group with five symbols. Each item in Form B contains two target symbols and a search group with five symbols.</p>

<p class="p1">&nbsp;<strong>Example of Symbol Search Targets and Search Groups, by Form</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>The child must indicate his or her response by touching the selected response on the child&#39;s screen.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Items with a white background are active and can register a child&rsquo;s response. Items with a gray background are inactive and cannot register a child&rsquo;s response.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>For each page of items, the initial item is active, and subsequent items are inactive. An item remains active until a response is made to the next item. No more than two items are active at a given time.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp; <img class="media_library_image" mediaid="4244" src="battery/wisc-v-commercialization/images/4244_SS active item.png" /></p>

<ul>
	<li>Self-corrections or other changes to initial responses are possible only on active items.</li>
	<li>
	<p>The arrow in the upper right corner of the child&rsquo;s screen (from his or her perspective) is used to advance to the next page. The arrow remains inactive until a response is selected for all items on the page.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Do not inadvertently touch the child&rsquo;s screen with your finger during administration of the demonstration and sample items, except when instructed (i.e.,your finger should hover above the child&rsquo;s screen when instructed to point at the target and search group, and you should touch the child&rsquo;s screen when instructed to demonstrate touching symbols).</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>If the child attempts to touch a target symbol at any time during administration, point across the search group and NO box on the child&rsquo;s screen and say, <strong><span class="speechBlue">Touch these over here.</span></strong> Do <strong>not </strong>pause timing to provide this prompt.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>If the child attempts to touch an inactive item at any time during administration, say, <strong><span class="speechBlue">You can only touch things on the white rows.</span></strong> Do <strong>not </strong>pause timing to provide this prompt</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>If the child asks what to do if he or she makes a mistake at any time during administration, say,&nbsp;<strong><span class="speechBlue">That&rsquo;s OK. Just keep working as fast as you can.</span></strong>&nbsp;Do&nbsp;<strong>not&nbsp;</strong>pause timing to provide this prompt.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Do not discourage the child from making spontaneous corrections unless he or she does so repeatedly and it impedes performance.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>If the child uses more than one finger to select responses at any time during administration, say, <strong><span class="speechBlue">You can only use one finger.</span></strong> Do <strong>not </strong>pause timing to provide this prompt. To record the event, first touch the List button, and then touch <strong>1F</strong>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Use the demonstration items to explain and illustrate the task to the child, then allow the child to practice by completing the sample items. If the child appears confused, repeat the explanation and demonstrate the task again, using the sample items. If it is clear the child will not be able to understand the task with further instruction, discontinue the subtest.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>If the child begins to complete the demonstration items, say,&nbsp;<strong><span class="speechBlue">I will show you how to do them first.</span></strong></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>During administration of the sample items, use the examiner&rsquo;s screen to monitor the child&rsquo;s responses so that immediate feedback may be provided. Correct responses are indicated with a green circle and incorrect responses are indicated with a red circle.&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>For the sample items, if the child touches the arrow before receiving corrective feedback for an error, touch the Redo Sample button on the examiner&rsquo;s screen and say,&nbsp;<strong><span class="speechBlue">Let&rsquo;s try those again.&nbsp;</span></strong>Administer the sample items again, providing corrective feedback for any errors.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>For the test items, if the child touches the arrow before he or she finishes all of the test items on a page, say,&nbsp;<strong><span class="speechBlue">Don&#39;t skip any.&nbsp;</span></strong>Point to the first omitted item on the child&rsquo;s screen and say,&nbsp;<strong><span class="speechBlue">Do this one next.&nbsp;</span></strong>Do&nbsp;<strong>not&nbsp;</strong>pause timing to provide this prompt.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>If the child finishes all of the test items on a page and does not touch the arrow or does not touch the arrow hard enough to advance the page, touch the arrow on the child&rsquo;s screen and say,&nbsp;<strong><span class="speechBlue">When you finish a page, touch the arrow and keep working as fast as you can.&nbsp;</span></strong>Do&nbsp;<strong>not&nbsp;</strong>pause timing to provide this prompt. To record the event, first touch the List button, and then touch&nbsp;<strong>AA</strong>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><em><strong>It is essential that you watch the child during completion of test items in the event that a prompt is required or the child hesitates to advance to the next page by touching the arrow.&nbsp;</strong></em></p>
	</li>
	<li>A check mark appears on the child&rsquo;s screen when the time limit expires or the child completes all of the test items. If the child stops working on the test items before the time limit expires, say,<strong><span class="speechBlue">&nbsp;Keep working as fast as you can until you see the check mark.</span></strong></li>
	<li>
	<p>Provide no further assistance on this subtest.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Detailed administration and scoring information can be accessed at any time during administration by touching the&nbsp;ⓘ&nbsp;button. For increased accessibility, verbatim prompts also can be accessed by touching the speech&nbsp;button.</p>

<h3>Record &amp; Score</h3>

<ul>
	<li>If the child uses more than one finger to select responses at any time during administration, record the event by&nbsp;touching the List button, and then the&nbsp;<strong>1F</strong>&nbsp;button.</li>
	<li>
	<p>If the child finishes all of the test items on a page and does not touch the arrow or does not touch the arrow hard enough to advance the page, record the event by first touching the List button, and then touch the&nbsp;<strong>AA</strong>&nbsp;button.</p>
	</li>
	<li>Do not score.</li>

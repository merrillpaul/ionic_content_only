<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Accurate timing is essential. Once initiated, timing is automatic. Do not pause timing during completion of Test Items.</p>

<h3>General Directions</h3>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>The pictured objects include animals and non-animals. The objects for Item 1 appear in random arrangements, and the objects for Item 2 appear in structured arrangements. Each test item is composed of four pages, labeled a&ndash;d (e.g., Item 2b denotes the second page of objects for Item 2). All pages of Item 1 and Item 2 are administered.&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Do not inadvertently touch the child&rsquo;s screen with your finger&nbsp;during administration of the demonstration and sample items, except when instructed (i.e., your finger should hover above the child&rsquo;s screen when instructed to point at the animal key, and you should touch the child&rsquo;s screen when instructed to touch a target animal).</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>If the child uses more than one finger to select responses at any time during administration, say, <strong><span class="speechBlue">You can only use one finger. </span></strong>Do <strong>not </strong>pause timing to provide this prompt. To record the event, first touch the List button, and then touch <strong>1F</strong>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>If the child asks what to do if he or she makes a mistake, say, <strong><span class="speechBlue">Touch it again to change it.</span></strong></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Do not discourage the child from making spontaneous corrections unless he or she does so repeatedly and it impedes performance.&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Use the demonstration item to explain and illustrate the task to the child, then allow the child to practice by completing the sample item. If the child appears confused, repeat the explanation and demonstrate the task again, using the sample item. If it is clear the child will not be able to understand the task with further instruction, discontinue the subtest.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>If the child begins to complete the demonstration item, say,&nbsp;<strong><span class="speechBlue">I will show you how to do it first.</span></strong></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>During administration of the sample item, use the examiner&rsquo;s screen to monitor the child&rsquo;s responses so that immediate feedback may be provided. Correct responses are indicated with a green circle and incorrect responses are indicated with a red circle.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>During administration of the test items, a check mark appears on the child&rsquo;s screen when the time limit expires for each page. If the child stops working on the test items before the time limit expires, say, <strong><span class="speechBlue">Keep working as fast as you can until you see the check mark.</span></strong></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Provide no further assistance on this subtest.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Detailed administration and scoring information can be accessed at any time during administration by touching the&nbsp;ⓘ&nbsp;button. For increased accessibility, verbatim prompts also can be accessed by touching the speech&nbsp;button.</p>
	</li>

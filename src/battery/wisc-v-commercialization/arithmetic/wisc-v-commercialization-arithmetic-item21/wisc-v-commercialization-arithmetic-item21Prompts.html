<p>To introduce Items 21&ndash;37, say,&nbsp;<strong><span class="speechBlue">I am going to read you some more problems. This time, you can ask me to read each problem&nbsp;<em>one</em>&nbsp;more time.</span></strong></p>

<p>Each item&nbsp;may be repeated at the child&rsquo;s request <strong><em>one time only</em>. </strong>If the child requests a repetition, <em>immediately</em> <a>stop</a>&nbsp;timing and repeat the item. Resume timing after the last word of the repeated item, and continue timing until the child responds or the time limit expires. Touch <strong>IR</strong> to indicate the item was repeated.</p>

<p>Touch the Stop button on the stopwatch when the child responds. If necessary (e.g., the child self-corrects after timing was stopped), touch Resume to continue timing until the child indicates his&nbsp;or her final response.</p>

<p>Record the child&rsquo;s responses verbatim, touch the appropriate score button,&nbsp;and swipe to the next page.</p>

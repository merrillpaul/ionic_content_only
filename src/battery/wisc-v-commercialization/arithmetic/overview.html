<p>To introduce the subtest, say,&nbsp;<strong><span class="speechBlue">I am going to read you some problems. Listen carefully, you can only ask me to read each problem one more time.</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Picture Items (Items 1&ndash;5)</strong></p>

<p>Follow instructions on the screen.</p>

<p><strong>Verbal Items (Items 6&ndash;20)</strong></p>

<p>Read each item verbatim.</p>

<p>Touch the Start button on the stopwatch to begin timing. Touch the Stop button on the stopwatch when the child responds. If necessary (e.g., the child self-corrects after timing was stopped), touch Resume to continue timing until the child indicates his or her final response.</p>

<p>Record the child&#39;s response verbatim, touch the appropriate score button, and swipe to the next page.</p>

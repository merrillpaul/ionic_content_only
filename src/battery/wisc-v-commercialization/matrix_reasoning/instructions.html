<h3>Items 1&ndash;33</h3>
</div>

<p>Follow the instructions on the screen.</p>

<p>Verbatim instructions may be shortened or eliminated when the child understands the task.</p>

<p>Detailed administration and scoring information can be accessed at any time during administration by touching the â“˜ button. For increased accessibility, verbatim prompts also can be accessed by touching the speech&nbsp;button.</p>

<p>Touch the Start button on the stopwatch to start&nbsp;timing. If the child has not responded within <em>approximately </em>30 seconds,&nbsp;prompt him or her by asking,<span class="speechBlue">&nbsp;<strong>Do you have an answer?&nbsp;</strong></span>Adjust the&nbsp;timing of this prompt and/or grant additional time if the child&nbsp;has established a pattern of providing delayed but correct&nbsp;responses as the item difficulty increases.</p>

<p class="p1">Stop timing when the child responds. If necessary (e.g., the child self-corrects after timing was stopped), touch Resume to continue timing until the child indicates his or her final response.</p>

<p class="p1">If the child provides multiple responses or&nbsp;self-corrects his or her initial response, ensure the intended response option is the&nbsp;<em><strong>only&nbsp;</strong></em>selected response on the examiner&rsquo;s screen. Deselect any unintended response options.</p>

<p class="p1">Touch the 0 Points button if the child says he or she does not know the answer, or the child does not respond within <em>approximately </em>30 seconds.</p>

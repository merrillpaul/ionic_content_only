<h3>Items 1&ndash;34</h3>
</div>

<p>Follow the instructions on the screen.</p>

<p>Verbatim instructions may be shortened or eliminated when the child understands the task.</p>

<p>Detailed administration and scoring information can be accessed at any time during administration by touching the&nbsp;â“˜&nbsp;button. For increased accessibility, verbatim prompts also can be accessed by touching the speech&nbsp;button.</p>

<p>Touch the Start button on the stopwatch to start&nbsp;timing.&nbsp;If the child has not responded when only 10 seconds remain in the time limit, prompt him or her by asking, <span class="speechBlue"><strong>Do you have an answer?</strong> </span>Do <strong>not </strong>stop timing to provide this prompt.</p>

<p>Stop timing when the child selects&nbsp;<em>three response options,</em>&nbsp;indicates that he or she does not know the answer, or the time limit expires. If necessary (e.g., the child self-corrects after timing was stopped), touch Resume to continue timing until the child indicates his or her final response.</p>

<p>If the child selects fewer than three response options for an item, provide the verbatim prompt from the speech button <em><strong>as often as necessary</strong></em>.</p>

<p>For all items, if the child self-corrects his or her response, ensure the intended response options are&nbsp;the <strong><em>only </em></strong>selected response options on the examiner&rsquo;s screen. Deselect any unintended response options.</p>

<p>Touch the 0 Points button if the child says he or she does not know the answer, or the child does not respond within the time limit. Responses completed after the time limit are scored 0 points.</p>

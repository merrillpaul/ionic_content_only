<h3>Timing</h3>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Accurate timing is essential. Once initiated, timing is automatic. Do not pause timing during completion of Test Items.</p>

<h3>General Directions</h3>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>All children begin with a qualifying item to determine if they have the requisite skills to use the Examinee Stylus and to familiarize them with the specific stylus they will use to complete the subtest. If it is clear that the child will be unable to demonstrate adequate stylus use with further instruction, discontinue the subtest. Do <em><strong>not </strong></em>allow the child to complete this subtest with his or her finger.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Do <strong>not </strong>inadvertently touch the child&rsquo;s screen with your finger or stylus during administration, except when instructed (i.e., your finger should hover above the child&rsquo;s screen when instructed to point at the key, and the stylus should touch the child&rsquo;s screen when instructed to draw a symbol).</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The child&rsquo;s screen becomes unresponsive if something other than the stylus creates a secondary point of contact on the active area of the screen. Usually, the secondary contact happens when the hand holding the stylus touches the screen (e.g., contact between the wrist and the screen). If the child&rsquo;s screen becomes unresponsive due to secondary hand contact at any time during administration, say, <strong><span class="speechBlue">Don&rsquo;t let your hand touch the screen.</span></strong> Do <strong>not </strong>pause timing to provide this prompt. To record the event, first touch the List button, and then touch <strong>HC</strong>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>To explain and illustrate the task to the child, use the Examiner Stylus to complete the demonstration items on the child&rsquo;s screen. If the child appears confused, repeat the explanation and demonstrate the task again, using the sample items. If it is clear the child will not be able to understand the task with further instruction, discontinue the subtest.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>If the child begins to complete the demonstration items, say,&nbsp;<strong><span class="speechBlue">I will show you how to do them first.</span></strong></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The arrow in the upper right corner of the child&rsquo;s screen (from his or her perspective) is used to advance to the next page. The arrow remains inactive until a mark is made in each shape or box on the page.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>For the sample items, if the child touches the arrow before receiving corrective feedback for an error, touch the Redo Sample button on the examiner&rsquo;s screen and say,&nbsp;<strong><span class="speechBlue">Let&rsquo;s try those again.&nbsp;</span></strong>Administer the sample items again, providing corrective feedback for any errors.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>For the test items, if the child touches the arrow before he or she finishes all of the test items on a page, say,&nbsp;<strong><span class="speechBlue">Don&rsquo;t skip any.</span></strong> Point to the first omitted item on the child&rsquo;s screen and say, <strong><span class="speechBlue">Do this one next.</span></strong> Do <strong>not</strong> pause timing to provide this prompt.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>If the child finishes all of the test items on a page and does not touch the arrow or does not touch the arrow hard enough to advance the page, touch the arrow on the child&rsquo;s screen and say,&nbsp;<strong><span class="speechBlue">When you finish a page, touch the arrow and keep working as fast as you can.</span></strong> Do <strong>not</strong> pause timing to provide this prompt. To record the event, first touch the List button, and then touch <strong>AA</strong>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>If the child uses his or her finger, instead of the stylus, at any time during administration, say,&nbsp;<strong><span class="speechBlue">Use the pen, not your finger.</span></strong>&nbsp;Do&nbsp;<strong>not&nbsp;</strong>pause timing to provide this prompt.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>If the child omits an item or begins to complete the items in reverse order (from his or her right to left) at any time during administration, say,&nbsp;<strong><span class="speechBlue">Do them in order.&nbsp;</span></strong>Point to the first omitted item on the child&rsquo;s screen and say,&nbsp;<strong><span class="speechBlue">Do this one next.&nbsp;</span></strong>Do&nbsp;<strong>not&nbsp;</strong>pause timing to provide this prompt.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>If the child asks what to do if he or she makes a mistake at any time during administration, say,&nbsp;<strong><span class="speechBlue">That&rsquo;s OK. Just keep working as fast as you can.</span></strong>&nbsp;Do&nbsp;<strong>not&nbsp;</strong>pause timing to provide this prompt.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Do not discourage the child from making spontaneous corrections unless he or she does so repeatedly and it impedes performance.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong><em>It is essential that you watch the child during completion of test items in the event that a prompt is required or the child hesitates to advance to the next page by touching the arrow.&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A check mark appears on the child&rsquo;s screen when the time limit expires. If the child stops working on the test items before the time limit expires, say,&nbsp;<strong><span class="speechBlue">Keep working as fast as you can until you see the check mark.</span></strong></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Provide no further assistance on this subtest.</p>

<h3>Record &amp; Score</h3>

<ul>

	<p>If the child&rsquo;s screen becomes unresponsive due to secondary hand contact at any time during administration, record the event by first&nbsp;touching the List button, and then touch the&nbsp;<strong>HC</strong> button.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>If the child finishes all of the test items on a page and does not touch the arrow or does not touch the arrow hard enough to advance the page, record the event by first touching the List button, and then touch the&nbsp;<strong>AA</strong> button.</p>
	</li>
	<li>Do not score.</li>

<p>Read each item verbatim to the child.</p>

<p>Each item may be repeated <em><strong>as often as necessary</strong></em>, but do not alter the wording in any way.</p>

<p>If the child&rsquo;s response is unclear or too vague to be readily scored or is followed by a <strong>(Q) </strong>in the sample responses, say, <strong>What do you mean? </strong>or <strong>Tell me more about it </strong>(or some other neutral inquiry)<strong>.</strong></p>

<p>If the child gives a verbal and a nonverbal response that are contradictory (e.g., says &ldquo;Four&rdquo; but holds up five fingers), ask the child to clarify by saying, <strong>Which one do you mean?</strong></p>

<p>Items with sample responses that require specific query are identified with an asterisk (*).</p>

<p>Items 1, 2, 12, and 13 are teaching items. Corrective feedback is provided if the child does not obtain a perfect score. Provide no further assistance on this subtest.</p>

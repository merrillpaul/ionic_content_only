<p>Say,<span class="speechBlue">&nbsp;I will say a word and then say another word that goes with it.&nbsp;Some word pairs will make sense, like sock and shoe, but others may not make sense, like laugh and stand.&nbsp;I will say a whole list of word pairs.&nbsp;Listen carefully because when I am finished, I will say the first word of each pair and ask you to tell me the word that goes with it.&nbsp;For example, if I say the word&nbsp;<em>sock</em>, you would answer</span>&nbsp;(pause)&nbsp;<span class="speechBlue"><em>shoe</em>&nbsp;and if I say the word&nbsp;<em>laugh</em>&nbsp;you would answer</span>&nbsp;(pause)&nbsp;<span class="speechBlue"><em>stand</em>.&nbsp;Do you understand?</span></p>

<p>If the examinee does not understand, you may repeat the directions. &nbsp;</p>

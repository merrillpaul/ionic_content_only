<p>Say, <strong><span class="speechBlue">I will briefly show you a screen with two symbols on it. Look carefully at the symbols and try to remember their order from left to right</span></strong> (point to the examinee&rsquo;s left, then right)<strong><span class="speechBlue">. Then I will show you a new screen and you will need to touch the symbols you saw in the order you saw them. Let&rsquo;s try one.</span></strong></p>

<p>Say, <strong><span class="speechBlue">Look carefully at these symbols.</span></strong></p>

<p>When the response selections appear on screen, say, <strong><span class="speechBlue">Now touch the two symbols I just showed you in the same order you saw them on the screen.</span></strong></p>

<p>Say,<span class="speechBlue">&nbsp;I am going to say a word and then say another word that goes with it. Some word pairs will make sense, like <em>sock </em>and <em>shoe</em>, but others may not make sense, like <em>laugh </em>and <em>star</em>.&nbsp;I will say a whole list of word pairs.&nbsp;Listen carefully because when I am finished, I will say the first word of each pair and ask you to tell me the word that goes with it.&nbsp;For example, if I say the word&nbsp;<em>sock</em>, you would answer</span>&nbsp;(pause)&nbsp;<span class="speechBlue"><em>shoe</em>&nbsp;and if I say the word&nbsp;<em>laugh</em>&nbsp;you would answer</span>&nbsp;(pause)&nbsp;<span class="speechBlue"><em>star</em>.&nbsp;Do you understand?</span></p>

<p>If the examinee does not understand, you may repeat the directions, paraphrasing when necessary.</p>

<p>When you are sure the examinee understands the directions, proceed to List A.&nbsp;</p>

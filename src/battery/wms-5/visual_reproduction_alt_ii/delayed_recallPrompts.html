<p>Turn to the page marked <em>Visual Reproduction II Delayed Recall &mdash; Item 1</em>&nbsp;in the Response Booklet and&nbsp;place&nbsp;it and a pencil in front of the examinee.</p>

<p>Say,<span class="speechBlue"> Earlier you looked at some designs and then drew them here</span> (point to Response Booklet)<span class="speechBlue">. I want you to draw the designs again. You don&#39;t have to draw them in the same order as you did before. If you saw one design by itself, just draw one design. If you saw two designs together, draw both designs just as your remember them. Now, draw one of the designs here</span> (point to the open page of the Response Booklet)<span class="speechBlue">.</span>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img class="give_timer" src="" /></p>

<p>If the examinee says he or she does not recall the designs, provide general encouragement by saying, <span class="speechBlue">Each screen had one or more designs on it</span> or<span class="speechBlue"> Just try to remember one of them.</span> Do not prompt the examinee by describing in words a design or any part of a design or by drawing a fragment of the design for the examinee.</p>

<p>After the examinee completes each response, stop timing. Turn to the next page in the Response Booklet and say,<span class="speechBlue"> Now draw another one of the designs here </span> (point to the page in the Response Booklet)<span class="speechBlue">.</span> Continue encouraging the examinee as necessary. Specific prompting is not permitted. Repeat these instructions until the examinee has drawn as many designs as he or she can remember. Remove the Response Booklet and pencil.</p>

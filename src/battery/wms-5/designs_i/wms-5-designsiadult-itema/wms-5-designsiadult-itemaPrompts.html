<p>Say, <span class="speechBlue">I will briefly show you a screen with four designs. Look carefully at the designs and remember where they are on the screen. I will then clear the screen and ask you to pick the four designs you saw from eight cards and place them in the correct places here</span> (point to the grid)<span class="speechBlue">.</span></p>

<p><img class="give_stimTimerNoThumbnail" customtimeout="false" data-stim-number="1" duration="10" src="" /></p>

<p>Say,&nbsp;<span class="speechBlue">Look carefully at the designs and remember where they are on the screen.</span></p>

<p>Reorient the examinee to the screen if he or she does not appear to be attending to it. Say,&nbsp;<span class="speechBlue">Look at the&nbsp;screen&nbsp;so you can remember the designs and where they are on the&nbsp;screen.</span></p>

<p>When the screen clears, shuffle Cards A1-A8 and place them in a stack in front of the examinee. Say, <span class="speechBlue">Pick the four designs you saw from these cards. Put the cards in the same places here</span> (point to the grid) <span class="speechBlue">as you saw them on the screen. Do not remove the cards when you are done.</span></p>

<p>Once the examinee&#39;s responses have been recorded, remove the cards from the Memory Grid and put the cards away. Place the empty grid in front of the examinee with the word EXAMINEE closest to him or her.</p>

<p>Say,&nbsp;<span class="speechBlue">Now I am going to say a word pair, and I want you to tell me if it is one of the pairs I said to you earlier. If it is one of the pairs I said before, say, &quot;yes.&quot; If it is not, say, &quot;no.&quot; Only say&nbsp;&quot;yes&quot; if both of the words in the pair match the word pair I said to you earlier. Ready?</span></p>

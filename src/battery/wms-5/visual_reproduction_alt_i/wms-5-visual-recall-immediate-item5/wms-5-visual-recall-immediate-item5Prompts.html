<p>Turn to the page marked <em>Visual Reproduction I &mdash; Item 5</em>&nbsp;in the Response Booklet&nbsp;and place it in&nbsp;front of the examinee.</p>

<p>Say,<span class="speechBlue">&nbsp;Now I will show you two new designs. Look at both of them carefully, because you will need to draw the designs just as you see them. Ready?</span></p>

<p><img class="give_stimTimerNoThumbnail" customtimeout="false" data-stim-number="1" duration="10" src="" />â€‹</p>

<p>Do not allow the examinee to begin drawing while the design is exposed.&nbsp;When the Client Device clears, say,<span class="speechBlue"> Now draw the designs.</span></p>

<p><img class="give_timer" src="" /></p>

<p>The examinee may erase and make corrections.</p>

<p>Stop timing after the examinee has finished drawing Item 5.</p>

<p>Say,<span class="speechBlue"> Later, I will ask you to draw all of the designs again, so try to remember them.</span></p>

<p>Remove the Response Booklet and pencils.</p>

<p>Turn to the page marked Visual Reproduction I &ndash; Item 4, Trial 1 in the Response Booklet and place it in front of the examinee.</p>

<p>Say,<span class="speechBlue">&nbsp;Now I will show you two designs. Look at both of them carefully because you will need to draw the designs just as you see them. Again, you will have 10 seconds to look at them</span><span class="speechBlue">. Ready?</span></p>

<p>​Present Item 4&nbsp;stimulus for 10 seconds. Do not allow the examinee to begin drawing while the design is exposed.</p>

<p><img class="give_stimTimerNoThumbnail" customtimeout="false" data-stim-number="1" duration="10" src="" />​</p>

<p>Saay,<span class="speechBlue"> Now draw the design.</span> Begin timing.</p>

<p><img class="give_timer" src="" /></p>

<p>The examinee may erase and make corrections.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Stop timing after the examinee has finished drawing.</p>
